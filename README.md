## **The Brief**

The group final project will involve concepts from previous training modules. Python, CI, Cloud and Agile.
Create an application that generates objects making use of an Agile methodology such as the Scrum framework.
Create a micro-service orientated architecture for the application composed of at least 4 services that work together.
Service 1 will render Jinja2 templates, communicating with services 2, 3 and 4. The services should be able to be updated without disrupting the user experience.
